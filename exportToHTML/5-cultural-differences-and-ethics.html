>What is culture?</h2><p id="7024e74c_10507">First things first, let's talk about culture. It's basically the habits and behaviors a group passes down through the generations. Take traditions and celebrations, like the Americans &quot;Santa Claus,&quot; for example&mdash;they're all part of culture. And then there's language, a big deal in distinguishing one culture from another. Ever heard of &quot;Gezellig&quot; in Dutch? There's no direct English translation for it. These little quirks are why people often dive into studying both the culture and language of a country together. You've got to put them in context to really get what's going on.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="what-is-the-hofstede-model" data-toc="what-is-the-hofstede-model"   >What is the Hofstede Model?</h2><p id="7024e74c_10508">The (Geert) Hofstede('s) Model of Cultural Dimension is a great model for analyzing a country's culture. It has 5 different Dimensions</p><ul class="list _ul" id="7024e74c_10509"><li class="list__item" id="7024e74c_10510"><p>Power Distance</p></li><li class="list__item" id="7024e74c_10511"><p>Individualism</p></li><li class="list__item" id="7024e74c_10512"><p>Masculinity</p></li><li class="list__item" id="7024e74c_10513"><p>Uncertainty Avoidance</p></li><li class="list__item" id="7024e74c_10514"><p>Long-Term Orientation</p></li></ul><section class="chapter"><h3 id="power-distance" data-toc="power-distance"   >Power Distance</h3><p id="7024e74c_10515">Hofstede's Power Distance Index assesses the willingness of individuals in an organization or society to accept unequal power distribution. It reflects the endorsement of inequality by both leaders and followers. For instance, Germany, with a score of 35, falls in the middle range, indicating a moderate acceptance of power disparity. In comparison, Arab countries show high power distance (80), while Austria has low power distance (11). Germany maintains a balance between wealth distribution and a belief in citizen equality. Conversely, the United States, with a score of 40, exhibits a more unequal wealth distribution compared to Germany, with a growing gap between the affluent and less affluent over time.</p><p id="7024e74c_10516">Here follows a map of Power Distance:</p><figure  id="7024e74c_10517"><img alt="PowerDistanceMap.png" src="images/PowerDistanceMap.png" title="PowerDistanceMap.png"  width="551" height="301"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="individualism" data-toc="individualism"   >Individualism</h3><p id="7024e74c_10518">individualism and collectivism are like how people work in groups. Take Germany, for example, they're at 67 on Hofstede's scale &ndash; people there are kinda doing their own thing. It's all about personal achievements and rights, making relationships more laid-back. Then there's Guatemala, scoring 6, all about collectivism. They're into closely connected groups. They focus on connections rather than the work. And in the U.S. &ndash; They have score of 91 which translates to Individualism. The &quot;American dream&quot; is about making it on your own from scratch. It's all about personal success and moving up.</p><p id="7024e74c_10519">Here follows a map of Collectivism</p><figure  id="7024e74c_10520"><img alt="Collectivismmap.png" src="images/Collectivismmap.png" title="Collectivismmap.png"  width="552" height="303"></figure><p id="7024e74c_10521">The thing that you can take away from that map is that most of the 'western'-culture are individualists. As a Dutch student I can confirm that most of the Dutch students around me are also individualists. Most of them would rather work from home or sit elsewhere in school then sitting in a classroom. You can also see this in the culture difference between demand and course based. There are much more</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="masculinity" data-toc="masculinity"   >Masculinity</h3><p id="7024e74c_10522">masculinity and femininity are all about how gender roles play out in a society. According to the IBM studies, women's values are kinda steady across different places, while men's values are all over the map &ndash; from assertive and competitive to modest and caring. The assertive and competitive side is labeled as 'masculine,' and the modest and caring side is 'feminine.' Take Germany, for example, scoring 66 on Hofstede's scale (way more than the Netherlands' 14). They're all about that masculine culture &ndash; being assertive, chasing material success, a bit self-centered, all about power, strength, and individual achievements. And look at the U.S. with a score of 62 &ndash; they're on the same page as Germany, leaning into those assertive and competitive vibes in their culture.</p><p id="7024e74c_10523">Here follows a map of the Masculinity:</p><figure  id="7024e74c_10524"><img alt="MasculinityMap.png" src="images/MasculinityMap.png" title="MasculinityMap.png"  width="553" height="293"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="uncertainty-avoidance" data-toc="uncertainty-avoidance"   >Uncertainty Avoidance</h3><p id="7024e74c_10525">uncertainty avoidance is about how comfortable or not people are with unclear situations in a society. High uncertainty avoidance, like in Germany (score of 65), means they're not enthusiastic of ambiguity. They tackle it with strict laws, rules, and a strong belief in absolute Truth. Germans like to plan everything meticulously to dodge uncertainties, sticking to regulations and preferring slow changes to play it safe. Now, check out the U.S. with a score of 46 &ndash; they're on the lower end of uncertainty avoidance. Americans are kind of okay with a bit of uncertainty. Their culture is more flexible, less hung up on strict rules and regulations compared to Germany. They're okay with a more easygoing approach to unstructured situations.</p><p id="7024e74c_10526">Here follows a map of the Uncertainty Avoidance:</p><figure  id="7024e74c_10527"><img alt="Uncertancy avoidancemap" src="images/uncertancy_avoidancemap.png" title="Uncertancy avoidancemap"  width="553" height="298"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="long-term-orientation" data-toc="long-term-orientation"   >Long-Term Orientation</h3><p id="7024e74c_10528">Long-Term Orientation, Hofstede's fifth cultural dimension, is designed to distinguish thinking patterns between the East and West. Originally introduced to capture this East-West distinction, it originated from a Chinese value survey conducted across 23 countries, taking into account the influence of Confucius in the East. Long-term orientation places value on persistence, hierarchical relationship structures, thrift, and a sense of shame. In contrast, short-term orientation prioritizes personal stability, safeguarding one's 'face,' respect for tradition, and reciprocation in social interactions like greetings, favors, and gifts. This dimension sheds light on the cultural disparities in perspectives regarding time, planning, and societal values between different regions.</p><p id="7024e74c_10529">Here follows a map of the Long-Term Orientation</p><figure  id="7024e74c_10530"><img alt="LongTermMap.png" src="images/LongTermMap.png" title="LongTermMap.png"  width="555" height="303"></figure></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="the-drawbacks-of-using-this-model" data-toc="the-drawbacks-of-using-this-model"   >The drawbacks of using this model</h2><p id="7024e74c_10531">Even though this model has been tested in a lot of different countries, it still doesn't mean that this applies to the individual of that country.

When Latvians hear the word <code class="code" id="7024e74c_10533">must</code> in an assignment they have todo, That task has the first priority. In comparison, The Dutch are a little bit more laid-back when it comes of doing things that <code class="code" id="7024e74c_10534">must</code> be done. latvians are much more disciplined Latvians are much more disciplined into doing tasks regardless of the difficulty.

As observed by my mother the Dutch students in her class were always procrastinating schoolwork. That resulted in the Dutch students to experience stress. In contrast, My mother was always early with finishing assignments and always asked for help at home. Because Dutch isn't her first language, She asked us to re-read her work to check if the spelling and grammar is correct.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="my-experience" data-toc="my-experience"   >My experience</h3><p id="7024e74c_10537">When doing (school) work, I started the semester very enthusiastic and completing tasks very early on, but as time went on, I have gotten more laid-back just like the Dutch students.
