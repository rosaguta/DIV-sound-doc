# Web Application

To improve the user experience on my website, I've created some elements with tailwind css. The following images are made tailwind css.

The Component that stays the same on every page after login is the sidebar. In the sidebar you can click on different elements to go to a specific page, view your name and logout if necessary 

#### Login page

#### Register page
the Login page and the Register page look quite similar. This is the user experience stays the same

#### Landing page after login

This is the landing page after the user logs in. This user already has a set of audio bites, and the user can add these to a board, or they can delete them. This page also allows the user to add multiple (.mp3) files to the board. In the bottom left corner, the user gets greeted with their name (yes the name in this instance is `string`).

#### soundboard page

On this page, you can see what files are added to the soundboard. The user has the ability to delete the soundboard, remove files from the board and play the sounds
