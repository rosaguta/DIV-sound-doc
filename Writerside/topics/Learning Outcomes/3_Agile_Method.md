## Scrum (GP)

for my groupproject we used **scrum** as our agile method

Scrum, a widely adopted Agile framework in software development, offers key advantages for our dynamic field. Its flexibility allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and respond swiftly to feedback. The iterative and incremental development approach, with sprints lasting two to four weeks, ensures regular inspection and adaptation, promoting continuous improvement and predictable product delivery.

Customer involvement is paramount in Scrum, with sprint reviews providing crucial touchpoints for stakeholder feedback. Transparency is maintained through artifacts like the product backlog and burndown charts. Collaboration and open communication are fostered through daily stand-up meetings and planning sessions.

Scrum's commitment to risk management is evident in its iterative nature, addressing risks early and reassessing regularly. The methodology optimizes resource utilization by prioritizing high-value features early in the development cycle, ensuring timely delivery of valuable work to stakeholders. In summary, Scrum's adaptability, collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement make it highly effective in the fast-paced software development landscape.

## Other methodologies

there are of course outer agile methods such as:

- **Software development**

  Software development is a comprehensive undertaking encompassing the conception, specification, design, programming, documentation, testing, and debugging phases. Its primary objective is the creation and upkeep of applications, frameworks, and other software components. Beyond the mere act of writing and maintaining source code, software development extends to a broader scope, encapsulating all processes from the initial conception of desired software to its final manifestation. This journey typically follows a planned and structured approach, often intertwining with the principles of software engineering. Moreover, software development is not limited to the coding aspect; it spans research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, and any other activities contributing to the production of software products.

- **Kanban**

    Kanban is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing. Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. The system takes its name from the cards that track production within a factory. Kanban is also known as the Toyota nameplate system in the automotive industry.

- **extreme programming**

  Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer satisfaction. It promotes a set of practices, such as continuous integration, test-driven development, and pair programming, to enhance software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. XP aims to deliver high-quality software in short development cycles, fostering a close working relationship between developers and customers throughout the project. This iterative and customer-centric approach helps in managing uncertainties and delivering a product that better aligns with user needs.
