## Scrum

for my groupproject we used **scrum** as our agile method

#### Why?

The reason we choose scrum is because its an easy way to add new things to the project without losing the structure of the project. And ofcourse there are also some other methods to achieve this but we didn't really look into those.
Scrum also allows for some customer involvement. In our case the stakeholder can add or remove some things for their liking.

#### What even is scrum?
If you're using scrum, you'll be working in sprints. each sprint is defined by an userstory that was set up beforehand before the project starts. By defining userstories, you basically set some functional requirements for your application. Each userstory is written in the view of the customer and needs to have a reasoning on why the user wants to have that functionality. Each usertory also has a few Acceptance Criteria. A userstory can look like this:
##### Userstory
As a **user** I want to be able to upload my sound bites to the website **so that** I can play them on the website. This is a userstory for my soundboard application (IP). 
##### Acceptance Criteria
1. The user must be able to upload sound files in mp3 format.
2. After uploading, the user should be able to see the uploaded sound files in the list of available sound bites on the website.
3. The uploaded sound files must be properly stored on the website's server and not damaged during the load process.
4. The user should be able to select and play an uploaded sound bite on the website by clicking on it.
5. The website should display a clear error message if an audio file upload fails so that the user is aware of the problem.
6. Playback of the sound files should be smooth without delays or stuttering on both desktop and mobile devices.
7. The website should be compatible with several popular web browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox) and should not cause compatibility issues during the uploading and playing of sound files.
8. The user must be able to upload multiple sound files and they must be displayed correctly in the list of available sound bites on the website.

## Other methodologies

there are other agile methods such as:

- **Software development**

  Software development is a comprehensive undertaking encompassing the conception, specification, design, programming, documentation, testing, and debugging phases. Its primary objective is the creation and upkeep of applications, frameworks, and other software components. Beyond the mere act of writing and maintaining source code, software development extends to a broader scope, encapsulating all processes from the initial conception of desired software to its final manifestation. This journey typically follows a planned and structured approach, often intertwining with the principles of software engineering. Moreover, software development is not limited to the coding aspect; it spans research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, and any other activities contributing to the production of software products.

- **Kanban**

  Kanban is a simple and easy way to plan things for your project. If you're working with Kanban, you'll be working in boards with columns like: `requested`, `in progress`, `done`. in these boards and columns you'll find cards with tasks on them. These tasks are related to user stories and only describe a small thing of the _todo_ list .Here follows an image of what Kanban can look like:

- **extreme programming**

  Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development approach driven by five core values. Emphasizing simplicity, XP encourages starting with the simplest effective solution. Communication is vital, promoting open dialogue and quick problem-solving within the team. The methodology integrates feedback directly, ensuring constant communication with customers for adaptability. Courage is required for honest updates and an adaptable approach to challenges. Respect is fundamental, fostering a culture of mutual respect among team members and with customers, creating a foundation for effective collaboration.
