## Without my soundboard application

This process is not optimal because everyone needs to have the same files on their own system. They also need to have a program in which can play these sound files (most operating systems have these). They also have to time the exact time to play those sound files. The timing of playing these sound files can ruin the _fun_ factor because they may need to pause their game or pause whatever else they are doing.


## With my soundboard application

This process is much more optimal for keeping the _fun_ factor. This process may need more steps and preparation but this is only for 1 user of the group. The rest of the group only need to open the shared link they got from **User A** and need to open it in their favorite browser. When clicking on sound file in the shared link, this will play the exact same time for you as for the rest.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the soundboard application offers a more streamlined and user-friendly experience compared to the traditional method. The conventional approach relies on everyone having the same files, a compatible program, and precise timing, which can be annoying and disrupt the overall enjoyment. On the other hand, the soundboard application simplifies the process for users in a group. With a shared link, only the initiator needs to go through additional steps, ensuring synchronized playback for the entire group without the need for individual file management or timing adjustments. This enhances the overall efficiency and fun factor of the sound-sharing experience.
