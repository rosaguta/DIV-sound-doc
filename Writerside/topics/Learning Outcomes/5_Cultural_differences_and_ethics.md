## What is culture?

First things first, let's talk about culture. 
It's basically the habits and behaviors a group passes down through the generations. 
Take traditions and celebrations, like the Americans "Santa Claus," for example—they're all part of culture. 
And then there's language, a big deal in distinguishing one culture from another. 
Ever heard of "Gezellig" in Dutch? There's no direct English translation for it. 
These little quirks are why people often dive into studying both the culture and language of a country together. 
You've got to put them in context to really get what's going on.

## What is the Hofstede Model?

The (Geert) Hofstede('s) Model of Cultural Dimension is a great model for analyzing a country's culture. 
It has 5 different Dimensions

- Power Distance
- Individualism
- Masculinity
- Uncertainty Avoidance
- Long-Term Orientation


### Power Distance

Hofstede's Power Distance Index assesses the willingness of individuals in an organization or society to accept unequal power distribution. 
It reflects the endorsement of inequality by both leaders and followers. 
For instance, Germany, with a score of 35, falls in the middle range, indicating a moderate acceptance of power disparity. 
In comparison, Arab countries show high power distance (80), while Austria has low power distance (11). 
Germany maintains a balance between wealth distribution and a belief in citizen equality. 
Conversely, the United States, with a score of 40, exhibits a more unequal wealth distribution compared to Germany, with a growing gap between the affluent and less affluent over time.

### Individualism

Individualism, measured against its counterpart, collectivism, gauges the extent to which individuals integrate into groups. 
In individualistic societies, such as Germany (scoring 67 on Hofstede's scale), interpersonal ties are loose, with emphasis on self-care and immediate family responsibility. 
Germany prioritizes personal achievements and individual rights, fostering loose relationships compared to collectivist societies. 
For instance, Guatemala, scoring 6, embodies collectivism, integrating individuals into strong, cohesive in-groups like extended families, marked by unquestioning loyalty. 
In the United States, a clear individualistic example with a score of 91, the "American dream" epitomizes the belief that anyone can rise from poverty through self-reliance, reflecting a focus on personal success and upward mobility.

### Masculinity

Masculinity, as opposed to femininity, relates to the distribution of gender roles in a society, presenting a fundamental issue with diverse solutions. 
The IBM studies found that women's values vary less across societies than men's values. 
Men's values span from assertive and competitive to modest and caring, with the former termed 'masculine' and the latter 'feminine.' 
For instance, Germany, scoring 66 on Hofstede's scale (compared to the Netherlands' 14), 0embodies a masculine culture emphasizing assertiveness, material success, self-centeredness, power, strength, and individual achievements. 
Similarly, the United States, with a score of 62, shares similar masculine values with Germany, reflecting a cultural emphasis on assertive and competitive traits.

### Uncertainty Avoidance

Uncertainty avoidance pertains to a society's tolerance for ambiguity, reflecting the extent to which individuals feel comfortable or uncomfortable in unstructured situations.
Cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, like Germany (scoring 65), minimize uncertainty through strict laws, rules, and a belief in absolute Truth.
Germans meticulously plan to avoid uncertainties and rely on regulations, preferring gradual changes to reduce risks. In contrast,the United States, scoring 46, exhibits lower uncertainty avoidance. 
The American culture embraces a relatively lower level of discomfort with unstructured situations, evident in a more flexible approach and a less rigid reliance on rules and regulations compared to Germany.

### Long-Term Orientation

Long-Term Orientation, Hofstede's fifth cultural dimension, distinguishes thinking between the East and West.
Initially added to discern this East-West difference, it arose from a Chinese value survey distributed across 23 countries, considering the influence of Confucius on the East.
Long-term orientation values persistence, hierarchical relationship ordering, thrift, and a sense of shame. In contrast, short-term orientation emphasizes personal steadiness, protecting one's 'face,' respect for tradition, and reciprocation in greetings, favors, and gifts.
This dimension reflects cultural differences in perspectives on time, planning, and societal values between regions.

## The drawbacks of using this model

Even though this model has been tested in a lot of different countries, it still doesn't mean that this applies to the individual of that country. 
The model has been proven to be right most of the time but do take it with a grain of salt

## What My mom and I Experienced of the Cultural differences

### My mom (I don't want to use my mothers full name so i'm going to use 'My Mom')

My mother was born in Russia and raised in Latvia during the USSR times. Her childhood at school is a very different. 
In latvia they are more strict than the Dutch.
Later when she moved to the netherlands and fast-forward a few years later, she started a HBO Training as a dialysis nurse. 
She was 1 of the few `outsiders` of her class in the first year. My mom did a things a little bit more differently. As observed by my mother the dutch students in her class were always procrastinating schoolwork. That resulted in the Dutch students to experience stress. In contrast, My mother was always early with finishing assignments and always asked for help at home. 
Because Dutch isn't her first language, She asked us to re-read her work to check if the spelling and grammar is correct.

She also noted that for russians that the word `must` is a must. Tasks that are defined with that word have to be done first and nothing comes in between. This is not really the case for dutch students. They are a bit more laid-back. This will lead to procrastination

Russians are also more disciplined into doing tasks regardless of the difficulty.
