# Requirements and design

>**Learning outcome**
>
>You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using multiple types of test techniques.
>
>**Clarification**
>
>Multiple types of test techniques: You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

**Observations**

**Common issues:**

Difficult to identify created characters and rooms.

Confusion about the edit button when accessing versions

Unclear indication of which character or room has been edited.

Confusion when saving changes without making any edits.

Images of characters not uniform in size when displayed in lines.


**Positive feedback:**

Appreciation for the loading indicator during character generation.

The ease of adding characters to a room.

Instructions were clear.

**Recommendations**

Consider adding character names to the library view for easier identification.

Clarify the purpose of the "Edit" button in the versions tab, or provide a more intuitive way to edit characters.

Include room names alongside images for better recognition.

Enhance the visual cues to clearly indicate the character/room that has been edited.

Implement a validation mechanism to prevent saving changes without modifications.

Standardize the display of character images for consistent and aesthetically pleasing view.

Provide clearer feedback when certain actions are performed, such as clicking on "Edit" multiple times in the version tab.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the usability tests for the Artificial Character Creator (ACC) provided valuable insights into the application's strengths and areas for improvement. Positive feedback highlighted features such as a loading indicator and the ease of linking characters to rooms. However, common issues, including problems identifying created characters and rooms, confusion over the edit button in the versions tab and uneven display of images, point to opportunities for refinement. The recommendations aim to improve the user experience by addressing these identified areas to promote a more intuitive and user-friendly ACC.
