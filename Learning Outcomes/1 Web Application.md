#### Landing page after login
This is the landing page after the user logs in. This user already has a set of audio bites, and the user can add these to a board, or they can delete them. This page also allows the user to add multiple (.mp3) files to the board. In the bottom left corner, the user gets greeted with their name (yes the name in this instance is `string`).

#### soundboard page
On this page, you can see what files are added to the soundboard. The user has the ability to delete the soundboard, remove files from the board and play the sounds
